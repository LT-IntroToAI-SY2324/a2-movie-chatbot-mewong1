# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
It was difficult figuring out how each condition should be programmed and why the conditions needed to be in that specific order. It took me a bit to realize how to make sure my code didn't have an output of an infinite loop.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use this program to check if a movie is already in the database. You could use the return statement to extract the data that includes that piece. For example, you could extract all movies that have the phrase "The great".
